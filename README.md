# USBReboot
A simple and clever tool to reboot your halted system when the network goes down and there's no keyboard or screen to recover it.
Useful for machines with physical access but unplugged from any screen or keyboard. I find it useful to reboot my Raspberry PI when the system is halted and the network goes down.
